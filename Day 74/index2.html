    <p>Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assume I'm human
        What do I need to do to understand that I am a superman?
        So I’m all innovative and rubbery
        You say it bounces and sticks to me because
        I’m more destructive than ever
        How to give a damn audience as it is levitating
        It never goes away, and I know the enemies are still waiting
        The day they can say I’m down, they’ll celebrate</p>
