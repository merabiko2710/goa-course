            <h1>Zhiguli</h1>
            <p>Zhiguli (Russian: Жигули, IPA: [ʐɨɡʊˈlʲi]) was a designation of cars based on the Fiat 124 manufactured
                in Russia and the Soviet Union by AvtoVAZ (formerly VAZ) during 1970-2012 and somewhat longer in some
                places abroad.[1] For the majority of export markets however the cars were sold under the Lada brand.
                <br>

                The car was also manufactured in Ukraine and in Egypt. In Egypt the last car of this model was
                manufactured in 2014.[2]<br>

                The designation is named after the Zhiguli Mountains by the Volga River, to match the name of the plant
                ('VAZ' stands for "Volzhsky Avtomobilny Zavod" or "Volga Automobile Plant").<br>

                There have been 7 models of this designation: VAZ-2101, VAZ-2102, VAZ-2103, VAZ-2104, VAZ-2105,
                VAZ-2106, VAZ-2107, with modifications indicated by an extra digit, see List of AvtoVAZ vehicles. The
                longest-living model was VAZ-2105 (1979-2010).<br>

                After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, a shortage of used cars meant that many export Zhigulis
                badged as Ladas were re-imported back from the West and hence the Lada brand became well known in Russia
                and the former Soviet states. The designation name was officially abandoned by the plant in the
                mid-1990s as Zhiguli was similar to the <br>word gigolo (Russian: жиголо, romanized: zhigolo), so
                AvtoVAZ now uses the Lada brand universally in all markets.<br>

    <h1>The assembly of Lada cars is being resumed in Egypt, TASS reported yesterday with reference to AvtoVAZ President Bo Andersson. The cars will be produced by al Amal Co., a representative of AvtoVAZ clarified. This enterprise is capable of producing 9,000 cars per year during one-shift operation. With al Amal Co. (formerly Lada Egypt) AvtoVAZ has been cooperating for 17 years, Andersson recalled. Initially, the company produced “classic” Ladas.
