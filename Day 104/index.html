  to perfection, optionally filled with your choice of cheese, vegetables, or meats.</p>
  <p>Preparation time</p>

  <ul></ul>
  <li> <b> Total:<b>> Approximately 10 minutes</li>
  <li><b>Preparation:<b> 5 minutes</li>
  <li><b>Cooking:<b> 5 minutes</li>

  <h1>Ingredients</h1>

  <p>2-3 large eggs
  Salt, to taste
  Pepper, to taste
  1 tablespoon of butter or oil
  Optional fillings: cheese, diced vegetables, cooked meats, herbs</p>

  <h1>Instructions</h1>

  <p>     1 Beat the eggs:</h> In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. <br>
  You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture. <br>

  2 Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.<br>

  3 Cook the omelette: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure <br>
  the eggs evenly coat the surface.<br>

  4 Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the<br> 
  middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.<br>

  5 Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the <br>
  fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.<br>

  6 Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.<br>
