1938 Type 57C
A Type 57C racing car was built from 1937 through 1940, with about 96 produced. It shared the 3.3 L engine from the road-going Type 57 but produced 160 hp (119 kW) with a Roots-type supercharger fitted.

Type 57C Tank
The 2nd incarnation Tank, this time based on the Type 57C, won Le Mans again in 1939. Shortly afterwards, Jean Bugatti took the winning car for a test on the Molsheim-Strasbourg road, on 11 August. Swerving to avoid a drunken bicyclist on the closed road, Bugatti crashed the car and died at age 30.

Type 57S/SC

The Type 57S/SC variants are some of the most iconic Bugatti cars. The "S" stood for "Surbaissé" ("Lowered") and the "C" for "Compresseur" (a supercharger introduced by Bugatti as a result of customers' desire for increased power). It included a V-shaped dip at the bottom of the radiator and mesh grilles on either side of the engine compartment.

Lowering the car was a major undertaking. The rear axle now passed through the rear frame rather than riding under it, and a dry-sump lubrication system was required to fit the engine under the new low hood. The 57S had a nearly-independent suspension in front, though Ettore despised that notion.

Just 43 "Surbaissé" cars[5] and only two supercharged Type 57SC's were originally manufactured. But most 57S owners wanted the additional power afforded by the blower. Therefore, most of the original Type 57S cars returned to Molsheim for the installation of a supercharger, pushing output from 175 hp (130 kW) to 200 hp (150 kW) and 190 km/h (120 mph).

Wheelbase: 2,979 mm (117 in)
Track: 1,349 mm (53 in)

Type 57S/SC "Aérolithe" concept and Atlantic production cars
The Type 57S Atlantic body featured flowing coupé lines with a pronounced dorsal seam running from the front to the back end of the vehicle. It was based on the 1935 Aérolithe concept car designed by Jean Bugatti which was built on a prototype chassis, more specifically, a standard Type 57 chassis shortened to what would eventually become the Type 57S chassis. Like the Type 59 Grand Prix car, the Aérolithe used Elektron composite for its body panels, known for being a very lightweight and durable material, but also for being extremely flammable when exposed to high temperatures. Therefore, being unable to weld the body panels, the engineers riveted them externally, a technique frequently used in the aviation industry, thus creating the signature seam.

However, the production Atlantics, just four built, used plain aluminium, but the dorsal seams were retained for style and have led to the car's present fame.[6][7] Three of the original four Atlantics are known to survive and each had been restored.[8] Two of them were awarded "Best of Show" awards at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in 1990 and 2003, respectively.

The model was named after Jean Bugatti's friend, French pilot Jean Mermoz, one of the pioneers in aviation and the first to cross the South Atlantic by air. In December 1936, he and his crew crashed into the Atlantic Ocean after a supposed engine failure. Originally, the Atlantic model was named "Coupé Aero" after its predecessor, the Type 57 Aérolithe. The first two production units already bore that name, but after hearing the tragic news, Jean Bugatti commissioned to change the name of the model to "Atlantic Coupé".

Bugatti's past during the pre-war and World War II era is often considered as being somewhat imprecise. Therefore, initially, it was believed that only three Atlantic cars were manufactured, as the popular belief hinged on the idea of No. 57453 (2nd Atlantic) and No. 57473 (3rd Atlantic) being the same car, for they were closely related in terms of production date and both being painted black by the Bugatti factory. However, in 2004, renowned Bugatti historian Pierre-Yves Laugier confirmed their separate identities, a research thoroughly comprised in his book entitled "Bugatti: les 57 Sport", along with an elaborate illustration of each vehicle's past.[9][10]

Code-named the "Elektron Coupé" or "Competition Coupé" at launch, this Bugatti prototype had a very short existence. It was finished around the end of July 1935 and only four months later, it made its first public appearance at the Paris Motor Show. The car was a faithful recreation of Jean Bugatti's stunning Art Deco inspired "SuperProfile coupé" design, but due to its seemingly bizarre shape, the vehicle has brought attention to a very limited audience, thus there were only four Atlantics built the years after. A few people, however, had the chance to sit in the vehicle next to Bugatti race driver William Grover-Williams while he offered them a "quick" tour of Paris and were surprised by the vehicle's performance and looks, so they called it "La Aérolithe" after the phrase "Rapide comme une aérolithe" ("Fast as a meteorite"), a name that was later adopted by Bugatti.

A few weeks later, the vehicle was displayed at the British International Motor Show in Olympia, London. The prototype remained in London until the spring of 1936, being frequently driven and tested by William Grover-Williams. Beyond this point, historians lose its tracks, but as Bugatti's chief mechanic Robert Aumaître stated a few decades later, the car was, essentially, just a styling concept with no technical interest, thus being transported back to France at the Bugatti factory where it was disassembled for components.[11]

Over the span of five years, from 2008 to 2013, Canadian car restoration team from The Guild of Automotive Restorers, led by David Grainger, had built a 1:1 exact replica of the Type 57 Aérolithe, having only 11 photographs, 2 blueprints and a painting at their disposal from which they gathered all the dimensions of the vehicle. It was built on the No. 57104 chassis and its body was crafted entirely out of Elektron alloy.[12]

It was completed on 2 September 1936 and sold to Victor Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild.[13] Painted a metallic gray-blue, No. 57374 was supposedly built using various components from the Aérolithe prototype, the most notable being the chromed elements on either side of the engine grille. In 1939, at the request of Victor Rothschild, the car was brought back to Molsheim in order to have the "C" specification supercharger fitted. He used the car until October 1941, when he abandoned it in the middle of a field after the engine exploded when the supercharger malfunctioned.

It was sold to a mechanic, who repaired it without the supercharger. In 1945, a wealthy American doctor who had just arrived in England bought the car, and a year later he brought it to the US and sold it to Bugatti enthusiast Mike Oliver. He brought the car up to U.S. specifications and painted it a dark red. In 1953, Oliver shipped the car to Bugatti and had a replacement supercharger fitted.

Before Oliver died in 1970 he sold the car to Briggs Cunningham, American entrepreneur, championship car racer, and pilot, owner of the "Costa Mesa" car collection. A year later it was sold for $59,000 to collector Peter Williamson, who owned it for 32 years, during which time he returned the car to its original state. Eventually, it was exhibited at the 2003 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance where it won the "Best of Show" award.[11]

Williamson died in 2004, and No. 57374 was sold in 2010 to a private collector associated with the former Mullin Automotive Museum in Oxnard, California, for $30 million.[14]

Also known as "La Voiture Noire" (French for "The Black Car"), this is the second Atlantic that was manufactured. Apart from its first years after production, the car's history and current whereabouts remain mostly unknown. Due to its past and exclusivity, experts had estimated the value of this car at around $114 million.[15]

On 10 March 1936, Greek racing driver Nico E. Embiricos ordered a Bugatti Type 57S Coupé Aero bearing chassis No. 57375 and engine No. 3S which was completed on 24 August 1936 and then shipped to his residence in London. By some unclear reason, once received, the car was sent to Corsica Coachworks for the conversion to a two-seater convertible racing body, this process coming to an end on 4 September 1936. The Coupé Aero bodywork was sent back to the Bugatti workshop, where it was eventually mounted on chassis No. 57453 with engine No. 2SC.[16]

Being the only Atlantic already fitted with the "C" specification supercharger straight from the factory, No. 57453 was completed on 3 October 1936. During the winter of the same year, the car was mostly driven by Jean Bugatti, racing driver William Grover-Williams and his wife, Yvonne. Subsequently, No. 57453 was photographed for the company's 1937 promotional catalogue and was also exhibited at the Nice and Lyon Motor Shows in the spring of 1937.[9]

Brought back to Molsheim, it was proudly driven by Jean Bugatti until the end of July, when he offered it as a gift to Bugatti race driver Robert Benoist after winning the 1937 24 Hours of Le Mans race. Being a very close friend with the Grover-Williamses, Benoist used the car alongside them. In the spring of 1940, all three of them fled to England before the Germans took over France and the car was returned to the factory. Even though it was frequently driven, No. 57453 never had a registered owner. The last mention about it was on a list of cars that were to be sent via a train to Rue Alfred Daney in Bordeaux on 18 February 1941, during the French exodus, being registered "1244 W5" and bearing chassis No. 57454.[9][17]

Jean Bugatti, who died on 11 August 1939 at the age of 30 in a car crash, often considered the Atlantic model and most notably No. 57453, as his most innovative and most valuable creation. Thus, at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show, commemorating the 110-year anniversary of both Jean Bugatti and the brand, Bugatti introduced the one-off model "La Voiture Noire" which was sold to an anonymous buyer for $19 million. According to the Bugatti stylistic team, the vehicle is the ultimate Grand Tourer, but also as a modern representation of No. 57453 and a tribute to Jean Bugatti's stylistic genius.[18]

Succeeding No. 57453, this second black Atlantic was finished on 13 December 1936 and was delivered to Parisian businessman, Jacques Holtzschuch. A few months later, while driving along the French Riviera, he and his wife, Yvonne, entered the "Juan-Les-Pins Concours d'Elegance" event where the vehicle received the "Grand Prix d'Honneur" award. Subsequently, between 1939 and 1941, the car received significant styling changes, so No. 57473 differs from the other Atlantics. The author of this coachwork is believed to be Italian designer Giuseppe Figoni.[9]

Eventually, Holtzschuch and his wife were captured and killed by Nazis by the end of World War II and the car was purchased alongside their Monaco mansion by Cannes businessman and mechanic Robert Verkerke in 1949. This owner entered the car in the "3rd International Speed Circuit for touring cars series" race in Nice, but failed to finish. Over the next couple of years, No. 57473 had more than three additional owners. In 1952, it was sold to Bugatti enthusiast René Chatard who commissioned to have it painted pale blue.

On 22 August 1955, Chatard and Janine Vacheron, a female companion, were driving the car near Gien, France, when they were hit by a train. Neither survived the crash and the vehicle was sold to a scrap trader in Gien. The remains of the car were purchased in 1963 by a French collector who began a full reconstruction which culminated in 1977. As a result of the severe deterioration, most of the original components were replaced with new ones, therefore the value of the car decreased substantially.

In November 2006, No. 57473 was bought by an anonymous collector, who decided that the vehicle should be thoroughly restored by American specialist Paul Russell and brought back to Chatard's specification. In 2010, the finished car was exhibited at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance event, where it didn't win any prize, being considered a replica. Today, No. 57473 is one among other classic cars displayed at the Torrota private collection in Spain.[11]

This final production Atlantic was built for British tennis player Richard B. Pope, delivered to him on 2 May 1938 before being registered "EXK6", as it's commonly referred to. Painted a rich sapphire blue, No. 57591 distinguished itself from the other Atlantics mostly by the "facelift" at the front end and the absence of the rear fender covers.

In 1939, Richard Pope sent the car back to Molsheim at the Bugatti factory to have the "C" specification fitted. He kept the car for nearly 30 years, sometimes loaning his Atlantic to Bugatti specialist Barrie Price.[11] Eventually, Price bought the car in 1967 and had it in its possession for 10 years. In the meantime, No. 57591 suffered a light crash during a commemoration which led to it getting stuck in a ditch. The car was handed to wealthy businessman Anthony Bamford and, shortly after, was given to another collector.

Eventually, fashion designer Ralph Lauren bought the car in 1988, and then commissioned a complete restoration with Paul Russell and Co. They restored the car to its 1938 condition, although it was painted black at Lauren's request. The car was given the "Best of Show" award at Pebble Beach in 1990 and "Best of Show" at Villa d'Este in 2013.

Shawn Henry evaluated 57591 at $100m.[19]

Type 57S/SC Atalante

Type 57SC Atalante
The Atalante was a two-door coupé body style similar to and built after the Atlantic, both built on the 57S chassis, but with a single-piece windscreen and no fin. The name "Atalante" was derived from a heroine of Greek mythology, Atalanta. Only 17 Atalante cars were made, four of which reside in the Cité de l'Automobile Museum in Mulhouse, France (formerly known as the Musée National de L'Automobile de Mulhouse).

One Atalante, chassis number 57784, a 3-seater vehicle version with aluminium bodywork made by Vanvooren of the iconic Bugatti Type 57S model, resides in the Museu do Caramulo in Caramulo, Portugal. Vanvooren would do two more bodies alike, one (Chassis 57808) for the French government, who gave it, in 1939, as a marriage gift for Prince Mohammad Reza and Princess Fawzia, and another one (Chassis 57749). These two cars are in private collections in the United States.[20]

Rediscovered Type 57S Atalante
Main article: Bugatti Type 57S Atalante (57502)
In 2008, the Bugatti Type 57S with chassis number 57502 (built in 1937 with the Atalante coachwork for Francis Curzon, 5th Earl Howe) was discovered in a private garage in Newcastle upon Tyne, having been stored untouched for 48 years and known only by a few people.[21] It was auctioned in February 2009 at the Rétromobile motor show in Paris, France, fetching €3.4 million.

Type 57S45
A special Type 57S45 used a 4,743 cc engine like the Tank.

        <h1>Bugatti veyron</h1>
        <img src="2.png"width="2000">
        <p id="q">The Bugatti Veyron EB 16.4 is a mid-engine sports car, designed and developed in Germany by the Volkswagen Group and Bugatti and manufactured in Molsheim, France, by French automobile manufacturer Bugatti. It was named after the racing driver Pierre Veyron.

            The original version has a top speed of 407 km/h (253 mph).[5][6] It was named the 2000s Car of the Decade by the BBC television programme Top Gear. The standard Veyron also won Top Gear's Best Car Driven All Year award in 2005.
            
            The Super Sport version of the Veyron is one of the fastest street-legal production cars in the world, with a top speed of 431.072 km/h (267.856 mph).[7] The Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse was the fastest roadster in the world, reaching an averaged top speed of 408.84 km/h (254.04 mph) in a test on 6 April 2013.[8][9] The production car speed record was later taken by another Bugatti, the Chiron, and then often changed hands for a while.[10]
            
            The Veyron's chief designer was Hartmut Warkuß, with the exterior being designed by Jozef Kabaň of Volkswagen. Much of the engineering work was conducted under the guidance of chief technical officer Wolfgang Schreiber. The Veyron includes a sound system designed and built by Burmester Audiosysteme.[11]
            
            Several special variants have been produced. In December 2010, Bugatti began offering prospective buyers the ability to customise exterior and interior colours by using the Veyron 16.4 Configurator application on the marque's official website.[12][13] The Bugatti Veyron was discontinued in late 2014, but special edition models continued to be produced until 2015.

            Origins
            
            
            Bugatti Veyron EB 16/4 Concept, a modified version of the 18/4 Veyron
            In May 1998, Volkswagen AG acquired the rights to use the Bugatti logo and the trade name Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. To succeed the EB 110 model produced under the previous ownership, the automaker quickly released a series of concept cars whose technological advancements would culminate in the form of the Veyron 16.4.
            
            Between October 1998 and September 1999, Bugatti introduced a series of Giugiaro-designed concept vehicles, each with permanent four-wheel drive and powered by the Volkswagen-designed W18 engine. The first car, the EB 118, was a 2-door luxury coupé presented at the 1998 Paris Motor Show. The next car, the EB 218, was a 4-door saloon presented at the 1999 Geneva Motor Show. The third and final car, the 18/3 Chiron, was a mid-engine sports car presented at the 1999 International Motor Show in Frankfurt.[14]
            
            In October 1999, Bugatti unveiled a fourth concept car at the Tokyo Motor Show. The EB 18/4 Veyron was a mid-engine sports car styled in-house under the direction of Hartmut Warkuß.[15] In 2000, a modified version, the EB 16/4 Veyron, was displayed at motor shows in Detroit, Geneva, and Paris. Rather than the three-bank W18 engine of the four previous concept cars, the EB 16/4 featured the four-bank WR16 engine architecture installed in every production example of the Veyron.[16] Warkuß also commissioned SEAT head of design, Walter de Silva, to submit a design proposal for the new Bugatti. The design was ultimately rejected in favour of Warkuß's own proposal.[17]
            
            The decision to start production of the car was made by the Volkswagen Group in 2001. The first roadworthy prototype was completed in August 2003. It is identical to the later series variant, except for a few details. In the transition from development to series production, considerable technical problems had to be addressed, repeatedly delaying production until September 2005.[18]
            
            The Veyron EB 16.4 is named in honor of Pierre Veyron, a Bugatti development engineer, test driver and company race driver who, with co-driver Jean-Pierre Wimille, won the 1939 24 Hours of Le Mans while driving a Bugatti.[19] The "EB" refers to Bugatti founder Ettore Bugatti and the "16.4" refers to the engine's 16 cylinders and quad-turbochargers.[20]
            
            Bugatti Veyron (2005–2011)
            Specifications and performance
            
            The Veyron's quad-turbocharged W16 engine
            The Veyron features an 8.0-litre, quad-turbocharged, W16 cylinder engine, equivalent to two narrow-angle V8 engines bolted together. Each cylinder has four valves for a total of 64, but the configuration of each bank allows two overhead camshafts to drive two banks of cylinders so only four camshafts are needed. The engine is fed by four turbochargers and displaces 7,993 cc (487.8 cu in), with a square 86 by 86 mm (3.39 by 3.39 in) bore and stroke.
            
            
            Bugatti Veyron 16.4
            
            Bugatti Veyron Interior
            The transmission is a dual-clutch direct-shift computer-controlled automatic transmission having seven gear ratios, with magnesium paddles behind the steering wheel and a shift time of less than 150 milliseconds, built by Ricardo of England rather than Borg-Warner, who designed the six speed DSG used in the mainstream Volkswagen Group marques. The Veyron can be driven in either semi-automatic or fully-automatic mode. A replacement transmission for the Veyron costs just over US$120,000.[21] It also has permanent all-wheel drive using the Haldex Traction system. It uses special Michelin PAX run-flat tyres, designed specifically to accommodate the Veyron's top speed, and cost US$25,000 per set.[21] The tyres can be mounted on the wheels only in France, a service which costs US$70,000.[21] Kerb weight is 1,888 kg (4,162 lb).[22] This gives the car a power-to-weight ratio, according to Volkswagen Group's figures, of 530 PS (390 kW; 523 hp) per ton. The car's wheelbase is 2,710 mm (106.7 in). Overall length is 4,462 mm (175.7 in) which gives 1,752.6 mm (69.0 in) of overhang. The width is 1,998 mm (78.7 in) and height 1,204 mm (47.4 in). The Bugatti Veyron has a total of ten radiators:[23]
            
            3 heat exchangers for the air-to-liquid intercoolers.
            3 engine radiators.
            1 for the air conditioning system.
            1 transmission oil radiator.
            1 differential oil radiator.
            1 engine oil radiator
            It has a drag coefficient of Cd=0.41 (normal condition) and Cd=0.36 (after lowering to the ground),[24] and a frontal area of 2.07 m2 (22.3 sq ft).[25] This gives it a drag area, the product of drag coefficient and frontal area, of CdA=0.74 m2 (8.0 sq ft).
            
            Engine power output
            According to Volkswagen Group and certified by TÜV Süddeutschland, the W16 engine utilised by the Veyron has a power output of 736 kW (987 hp; 1,001 PS), and generates 1,250 N⋅m (922 lbf⋅ft) of torque.[26][27][28]
            
            Top speed
            German inspection officials recorded an average top speed of the original version at 408.47 km/h (253.81 mph)[6] during test sessions on Volkswagen Group's private Ehra-Lessien test track on 19 April 2005.
            
            This top speed was almost matched by James May on Top Gear in November 2006, at the Ehra-Lessien test track, at 407.5 km/h (253.2 mph).[6] May noted that at top speed the engine consumes 45,000 L (9,900 imp gal) of air per minute (as much as a human breathes in four days). Back in the Top Gear studio, co-presenter Jeremy Clarkson commented that most sports cars felt like they were shaking apart at their top speed, and asked May if that was the case with the Veyron at 407 km/h (253 mph). May responded that the Veyron was very controlled, and only wobbled slightly when the air brake deployed.[29]
            
            The car's normal top speed is listed at 343 km/h (213 mph). When the car reaches 220 km/h (137 mph), hydraulics lower the car until it has a ground clearance of about 9 cm (3.5 in). At the same time, the wing and spoiler deploy. In this handling mode, the wing provides 3,425 newtons (770 lbf) of downforce, holding the car to the road.[23]
            
            Top speed mode must be entered while the vehicle is at rest. Its driver must toggle a special top speed key to the left of their seat, which triggers a checklist to establish whether the car and its driver are ready to attempt to reach 407 km/h (253 mph). If so, the rear spoiler retracts, the front air diffusers shut, and normal 12.5 cm (4.9 in) ground clearance drops to 6.5 cm (2.6 in).
            
            Braking
            The Veyron's brakes use cross drilled, radially vented carbon fibre reinforced silicon carbide (C/SiC) composite discs, manufactured by SGL Carbon, which have less brake fade and weigh less than standard cast iron discs.[30] The lightweight aluminium alloy monobloc brake calipers are made by AP Racing; the front have eight[23] titanium pistons and the rear calipers have six pistons. Bugatti claims maximum deceleration of 1.3 g on road tyres. As an added safety feature, in the event of brake failure, an anti-lock braking system (ABS) has also been installed on the handbrake.
            
            Prototypes have been subjected to repeated 1.0 g braking from 312 km/h (194 mph) to 80 km/h (50 mph) without fade. With the car's acceleration from 80 km/h (50 mph) to 312 km/h (194 mph), that test can be performed every 22 seconds. At speeds above 200 km/h (124 mph), the rear wing also acts as an airbrake, snapping to a 55° angle in 0.4 seconds once brakes are applied, providing an additional 0.68 g (6.66 m/s2) of deceleration (equivalent to the stopping power of an ordinary hatchback).[23] Bugatti claims the Veyron will brake from 400 km/h (249 mph) to a standstill in less than 10 seconds, though distance covered in this time will be half a kilometre (third of a mile).[23]

        <p>The Subaru Outback is an automotive nameplate used by the Japanese automaker Subaru for two different SUV-themed vehicles: a Legacy-derived crossover station wagon, the Outback (1994–present, also sold as Legacy Outback (Japanese: スバル・レガシィアウトバック, Hepburn: Subaru Regashi Autobakku) in some markets), and an Impreza-derived off-road themed hatchback, the Outback Sport (1994–2011).

            Most versions of the Outback wagon and Outback Sport have had all-wheel drive as standard equipment.
            
            History
            
            
            First generation Subaru Legacy station wagon (1989–1993), before the model gained the "Outback" name
            The original Outback station wagon was derived from the wagon variant of the second-generation Subaru Legacy. The first-generation Legacy, which made its debut in 1989, did not receive the cosmetic and suspension modifications to create an Outback version, although Subaru offered an Outdoor option package for the 1994 model year Legacy L all-wheel drive model, which added a compressed air strut height adjustable suspension, a luggage rack, a skidplate, and mud flaps.[1][2][3]
            
            Earlier, a raised-roof "Touring Wagon" variant had been offered on the preceding Subaru Leone for the 1988 and 1989 model years.[4] Subaru also sold a raised-roof variant (chassis code BF) of the first-generation Legacy wagon outside the United States. North American Legacy wagons were only offered as the flat-roof variant (chassis code BJ) until a special "GT" model was marketed for the 1994 model year.[5]
            
            The second-generation Legacy wagon became the first generation of the Outback crossover series, called the "Legacy Grand Wagon" in Japan in 1995, and the "Legacy Outback" in most other markets. Compared to the existing Legacy wagon, the "Outback" variant added partial protective plastic side body cladding for off-road conditions, used a raised roof, and would later raise the suspension to provide additional ground clearance. It was introduced at the 1994 New York Auto Show.[6] Aside from other small differences in trim, the Outback shares almost all of its components with the Legacy donor model.
            
            When launched in Australia in 1996, the name "Legacy Outback" was shortened to "Outback", followed in other markets afterwards. In the United States, Subaru also retailed the Legacy SUS sedan between the 1997 and 2007 model years, with similar modifications to distinguish it from the equivalent Legacy model sedan.[7] The Impreza Outback Sport was introduced at the 1996 New York Auto Show, but for the 1997 model year, the donor model names were dropped, and the cars were known as the "Outback" and "Outback Sport".[8]

            The Outback concept originated with Subaru of America, which was suffering from slumping sales in the mid-1990s partly due to a lack of an entry in the then-burgeoning sport utility vehicle market. Lacking the finances to design an all-new vehicle, Subaru decided to add body cladding and a suspension lift to their Legacy wagon. Named the Legacy Outback, after the Australian outback, actor Paul Hogan was the spokesman in the North American market, playing off the Australian name of the vehicle and portraying the vehicle as a capable and more efficient alternative to large, truck-based SUVs. Sales exceeded expectations, with Tim Mahoney, Senior Vice President of Subaru of America stating "[the Outback] saved our company."[9]
            
            The Legacy Outback was formally introduced to the North American market at the 1994 New York Auto Show,[citation needed] and was known in Japan starting August 1995 as the Legacy Grand Wagon, and in Australia as the Outback, a trim package with normal ground clearance but an "SUV look" with two-tone paint and fog lights. In Japan the Legacy wagon was called the Legacy Touring Wagon so the "Grand Wagon" nomenclature was meant to signify a more grand, luxurious approach to equipment offered. The exterior was designed by Olivier Boulay, who was hired by Subaru on a short-term basis.
            
            For the 1995 model year, the first year the Outback was introduced, the Outback was a trim package on the base model Legacy wagon "L", that primarily consisted of the heavy cloth interior, Berber carpet floor mats, a luggage rack and fog lights with a standard height suspension. This approach was also used on the smaller Impreza wagon, with the name Outback Sport. When the 1996 model year arrived, it gained more aggressive appearing front bumper covers, with larger rallye inspired driving lamps replacing the previously installed fog lights, taller tires with more aggressive tread, and a 7.8 in (198 mm) ground clearance, with a 7.87 in (200 mm) ground clearance in Japan. The more aggressive appearance was also used on the smaller Outback Sport while omitting the increase in ground clearance from suspension modification. This approach was inspired by the Legacy having been entered into international rallying and long distance racing events, and winning the 1990 Safari Rally in the Group N category. In 1996, the MY1997 Outback received the hood scoop installed in the engine hood (bonnet) without installing an intercooler, commonly used in conjunction with a turbocharger.
            
            The previous generation Legacy wagon had an optional air suspension, which allowed the driver to temporarily increase the vehicle's ground clearance, however the permanent increased ride height used on the Outback proved to be more practical. Subaru sales had been declining up until that point in North American market. With the help of clever marketing, a trim level called the Outback intent on making the Subaru a more capable multi-terrain vehicle offered an affordable and fuel efficient alternative to the popular SUVs that were outselling Subaru's traditional offerings.[9] The Legacy and Outback wagons were built at the Subaru of Indiana Automotive production facility in Lafayette, Indiana that also manufactured the Isuzu Rodeo and the badge engineered Honda Passport, traditional SUVs with transfer case installed four-wheel-drive and an extended ground clearance.
            
            In September 1997, the Japanese Legacy Grand Wagon was renamed Legacy Lancaster though 1998 cars retained the Grand Wagon nameplate along with the new Lancaster plate. Earlier versions of the Outback continued to use the EJ22 four cylinder engine, while later generations introduced the larger EJ25 four cylinder engine, revised with DOHC and more horsepower. The JDM Grand Wagon and Lancaster were only available with the DOHC 2.5-litre flat-4 engine, receiving a 10 hp (7.5 kW) improvement in 1998. Some Japanese-spec Grand Wagons came with digital climate control, plaid seat upholstery, a dual-range manual transmission and a Momo black leather steering wheel.
            
            All trim levels retained the typical AWD layouts seen in previous generation Legacy, depending on transmission choice. Manual transmission models came with a mechanical "Continuous AWD" system which was normally 50/50 front/rear, and relied on limited slip differentials to redirect power front to rear, rear to front, and from one rear wheel to the other (when fitted with a rear limited slip differential). – No USA Legacy models had front or rear limited slip differential from '92–99 – including Outback versions. Automatic transmission models had an electronically controlled AWD system that was 90/10 front/rear and redirected differing amounts of power to the rear wheels continuously. When accelerating or driving uphill, the vehicles weight shifts rearward, reducing front wheel traction, causing the transmission to automatically send torque to the rear wheels to compensate. When braking or driving downhill, the vehicle's weight shifts towards the front, reducing rear wheel traction. The transmission again compensates by sending torque to the front wheels for better steering control and braking performance. If the automatic is placed in Reverse or "1st" gear, the transmission divides the torque 50–50 to both front and rear wheels.

            The Legacy SUS (short for "Sport Utility Sedan")[citation needed] was launched with a limited production test run sold in USA in 1998[citation needed] and, based on its success, was rolled out in North America only the following year. The "Limited" trim level package for the Outback wagon was standard equipment on the sedan body, with the addition of a hood scoop and trunk-mounted rear wing. Despite the appearance of the front hood scoop, the SUS was not installed with a turbocharged engine; the only engine installed from Subaru was the naturally-aspirated EJ25D engine. The "SUS" moniker was removed with the introduction of the second generation Outback Sedan. Plastic side cladding was not present on the side doors of the Outback; the lower half of the doors were painted a contrasting color also found on the front and rear bumper covers.

            With the arrival of the third generation Legacy, the second generation Outback wagon became its own model. The Legacy SUS remained unique to North America and was realigned with the Outback Limited package, offering the sedan with an optional horizontal six-cylinder engine, also optional on the wagon. The new body style was introduced to Japan in September 1998 and called the Lancaster. The USA-spec Outback was available starting in 2000. In October of that year, Nissan introduced a Japan-only called competitor with an Outback-like appearance called the Nissan Avenir Blaster.
            
            The raised roof was retained, but the new body was smoother, rounder, and about 3 inches longer, with a slightly longer wheelbase. A new version of Subaru's flat four-cylinder "boxer" engine was standard, offering more low-end torque, better fuel economy, and smoother performance. There were no changes to the front suspension, but there was a complete makeover of the rear suspension, which included a new design that occupied less of the backspace, adding more room in the trunk and cargo floor. Safety improvements consist of three-point seat belts for the driver and additional four passengers. There is also a child-safety-seat anchor for all of the seat positions in the back. For the front, the seat belts are positioned to better hold the driver and front passenger along with front and rear airbags installed to protect the occupants in a collision. The Subaru Outback received a good rating from The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in 2000 for its performance in a safety demonstration of a crash test at 40 miles per hour. The Outback has been since developing to make it as safe, smooth, and convenient a ride that it can be.
            
            The rear seat on the Outback sedan does not fold down, unlike previous generations where the rear seat had a 60:40 folding seat for extended length items. Rear headrests are now included as standard equipment on all trim levels. The ground clearance is 7.3 in (190 mm). The engine now meets California's LEV emission standard.
            
            The Outback came standard with a 165 hp (123 kW) by SAE, 4-cylinder boxer engine, four-cylinder SOHC design with a maximum torque of (166 lb⋅ft (225 N⋅m)) that was available at a lower RPM compared to the previous generation. The 2.5 L SOHC four-cylinder engine uses a timing belt that must be replaced around 100,000 miles (160,000 km), whereas the 3.0 L six-cylinder engine uses a timing chain that does not require replacement under normal conditions.
            
            The base model six-cylinder was offered as the H6-3.0 — its interior, and available options, were identical to those of the Outback "Limited", with the exception of a manual transmission, although many successful non-factory transmission swaps have proven that it physically bolts up without issue (but still requires some significant modifications to the electrical system). Badging for all 6-cylinder Outbacks was located on the front grille as well as on the rear of the vehicle.
            
            In a higher trim level, known as the Outback H6-3.0 L.L. Bean in the USA, it included standard features like an in-dash six-disc CD changer, automatic climate control, leather upholstery, and dual moonroofs. OnStar was available as an option on the USA-spec L.L. Bean and VDC trims. In-dash satellite navigation was offered on Japan-spec vehicles on upper trim level wagons starting with Model Year 1998 and continued to offer a Momo black leather steering wheel with genuine wood inlay, shift knob, and parking brake handle. Plaid upholstery was still offered on Japan-spec Lancasters.
            
            The six-cylinder was also available as the Outback H6-3.0 VDC; a 200 Watt McIntosh stereo system was standard from 2001 to 2004 with Subaru's VDC (Vehicle Dynamics Control) system, which integrated stability control with traction control. These were some of the only vehicles ever factory-equipped with McIntosh stereo equipment. The system was also mated to a previously used Japanese-market AWD system, called VTD, in which power was split 45/55 front-to-rear in normal conditions. When wheel spin is detected, the system cuts power to the spinning wheel and directs power to those that are not. Only when necessary do the brakes slow the affected wheels, when the vehicle detects excessive oversteer or understeer. This package had more sound insulation than other trims, as well as those features found on the H6-3.0 L.L. Bean, such as dual moonroofs, OnStar, and leather upholstery. Its curb weight was just slightly higher than that of the standard H6-3.0 L.L. Bean trim, and while the VDC badging was placed on the front quarter panels only, the H6-3.0 and Outback markings were also applied as usual.

            Australian-specification vehicles differ from cars delivered in the United States by following the Japanese models; primarily headlights, side indicators (on front quarter panels), rear taillights, front and rear bumpers, and a higher placing of the "Outback" badging on the front door bodywork (as opposed to being placed on the plastic cladding).
            
            This generation of Outback was released in an early style with gold-colored cladding, all-in-one headlights (not dissimilar to the US model headlights), and internally a light gray cloth (sometimes speckled with various colors), a light brown wood textured dashboard and a plain instrument cluster. A nudge bar (a smaller style of bullbar or roo bar) was also available as an aftermarket option. The later style (2002–2004) was updated with silver cladding, an updated range of paint colors, multi-unit headlights (where headlight and indicators were in different sections of the unit) and internally a dark gray/black cloth, dark gray plastics, a very dark brown faint wood texture, and metal trims on the dials of the instrument cluster.
            
            Models available included the base "Outback", the "Outback Limited" which added a sunroof and cloth/leather seats and the "Outback H6" which included the 6-cylinder engine with VDC as described in this article. The H6 was released with slightly different 16-inch wheels and available in a single metallic pearl off-white color instead of the usual color with gold or silver cladding. The H6 was only available in automatic, apparently due to the size of the 6-cylinder engine taking up too much space to fit the manual box and associated dual-range mechanicals.

            The Lancaster (as known in Japan) was released originally in September 1998 following the original release of the third-generation Legacy in May 1998. The Lancaster models were available originally in 2.5 L engine size with the E-4AT transmission or 5-Speed Manual Car. In May 2000, Subaru released the Lancaster 6, featuring Subaru's reborn Flat-6 engine. This was in production from April 2000 to May 2001 when Subaru released the facelifted Legacy models included a revised Lancaster design. These changes were seen on 'Outbacks' produced in Japan, US built Outbacks did not use the facelifted design released by Subaru Japan.
            
            The Lancaster ADA (Active Driving Assist) was introduced in September 1999. The system featured two CCD cameras mounted either side of the rear-view mirror. The system was installed on 2.5 L models with VDC and then later in 2000 on the newer Lancaster 6 VDC models.[10]
            
            The ADA system featured 4 key safety components:
            
            Function	Description
            Lane Departure Warning	ADA will detect when the vehicle is diverging from the intended course of the road. An audible sound is made through the navigation system and dashboard warnings are illuminated.
            Inter-vehicle Distance Warning	When the ADA detects the car fast approaching another vehicle in front, the system will warn the driver via an audible sound.
            Dynamic Cruise Control	Whilst cruise control is active, ADA will keep the vehicle at a safe distance from the car in front. This in turn requires no input from the driver when the car is fast approaching a vehicle ahead.
            Curve Alarm / Shift Down	If ADA detects an upcoming corner and calculates the car could face loss of traction or under/oversteer, ADA will warn the driver audibly and down-shift the transmission automatically to provide engine braking to the vehicle in order to slow it before entering the corner.
            While Subaru's newly marketed ja:EyeSight (Japanese) system (essentially ADA) found in the 5th generation Legacy and Outback draws media attention for 'new advanced technology', the ADA system was actually a system developed back in the late 1990s along with the development of the 3rd Generation Legacy and is no means 'new technology' as such, but more a 'newly recognised' system for a more safety-conscious global market.

            On October 22, 2003, with the debut of the third-generation Legacy at the 60th Frankfurt Auto Show, the Outback name was now being used in all markets with the launch of the third-generation Outback crossover, which until that point had only been used in export markets. Models equipped with a 3.0L EZ30D H6 were introduced at the 2004 Chicago Auto Show. The ground clearance is 8.5 in (220 mm) in the US, so as to get around fuel economy regulations,[11] and 7.8 in (200 mm) most elsewhere. In some countries, such as Canada, it varied by what engine was installed.
            
            This generation of Outback carried the same model codes as the Legacy Wagon: BP9 for the 2.5-litre model and BPE for the 3.0-litre model. The highest trim level offered in the United States was the Outback "L.L. Bean Edition" that offered optional equipment as standard, including a wood and leather steering wheel, an auxiliary port on the stereo for external music player compatibility (2007 and later), perforated leather seats, GPS navigation, a double-sized, one-piece glass moonroof, limited-slip differential, and the 3.0-litre H6 engine. Starting with this generation, the interior retractable rear cargo cover had a separate stowage compartment in the spare tire storage area so that the cargo cover could be removed for large items and stowed out of the way inside the vehicle.
            
            A new Outback variant for the 2005 and newer years was the Outback XT. This model came with the same turbocharged 2.5L EJ255 4-cylinder engine found in the Impreza WRX model. This engine produced 243 hp (181 kW), which was much higher than the naturally aspirated 2.5L engine, which produced 175 hp (130 kW). The XT model came equipped with any 2 of the 3 standard transmissions: a 5-speed Auto-SportShift, or a 5-speed manual.
            
            In 2007, the Outback (along with the Ford Mondeo) won Top Gear's "Car of the Year" award.[12]
            
            As of the 2008 model year, the Legacy wagon and Outback sedan were discontinued in the United States, leaving only the Legacy sedan and Outback crossover models. The Outback crossover also received styling revisions for the 2008 model year, most notably an enlarged, chrome-ringed grille. Additionally, in July, 2008 Subaru ceased offering a special edition L.L. Bean trim level on the Outback.[13]
            
            For 2008, the 2.5i USA model was certified PZEV emissions and a "PZEV" badge attached to the rear of the vehicle on the bottom right hand side of the tailgate. All other models were certified LEV2. The PZEV Outback was available for sale in all 50 states, unlike other manufacturers, who usually only sell PZEV certified vehicles in states that have adopted California emission standards.
            
            EyeSight
            Starting May 2008, the Japanese-spec Legacy could be fitted with a new safety feature called EyeSight. It consists of two cameras, one on each side of the rear-view mirror, that use human-like stereoscopic vision to judge distances and generally keep tabs on the driver. The system helps maintain a safe distance on the highway, warns the driver during unintended lane departure, emits a wake up call should everyone else pull away from the traffic lights, and keeps an eye out for pedestrians.[14][15] SI-Cruise has been integrated into the EyeSight feature as a driver safety aid.
            
            Diesel
            The Subaru EE series flat-4 diesel engine was offered in both Legacy and Outback models in Europe exclusively. These diesel models were introduced at the Geneva Motor Show in March, 2008. Identified as the "Subaru Outback 2.0D", it was offered with a 5-speed manual transmission only. The top-of-the-line JDM and EU diesel models also had a "Start/Stop" button, similar to those found in Lexus, Infiniti, Audi and other high end makers.
            
            According to the Subaru Owners on-line newsletter dated March 2008, Subaru was planning to introduce the diesel Legacy and Outback models in the U.S., stating they were "...currently making modifications to the diesel so it meets the more stringent U.S. standards. Subaru diesel models should be domestically available in two to three years."[16][17][18] However, there has yet to be a diesel version of any Subaru model introduced into the U.S.

            Interior
            Based on the fifth generation Legacy, the fourth generation Subaru Outback was introduced in April 2009 at the New York Auto Show, the fifteenth anniversary of the first Outback's introduction at the same event. The Outback was introduced in Japan May 20, 2009.[19] The "Legacy" prefix has been dropped internationally. Air Bags are offered for the driver and front passenger, side bolster airbags for front seats on the outer edge, side curtain airbags for front and rear passengers and a knee bolster air bag for the driver.
            
            The ground clearance increases to 8.7 in (220 mm), and is the ninth Subaru vehicle to feature continuously variable transmission (CVT). The double-sized moonroof is no longer being offered, and has been reduced to a conventional size that doesn't extend over the rear seats. The turbocharged engine is also no longer offered on all international versions of the Outback. An engine coolant temperature gauge is no longer offered, replaced by a fuel economy gauge instead. When the engine temperature is below normal, an indicator light shines blue and when the engine is overheating, the light turns red. Using the key to unlock the drivers' door after locking the vehicle with the remote will set off the security system; the vehicle must be unlocked with the remote, a tradition going back to the first generation when remote keyless access was introduced.
            
            The side windows are no longer frameless, ending a Subaru tradition started with the first generation Leone in the early 1970s. The "D" pillar on the crossover is no longer covered in glass, also ending a design tradition established with the first generation and borrowed from the Subaru XT. The front and rear bumper covers are no longer painted a contrasting color, but the plastic side body cladding continues. The external "Limited" badge has been retired on North American vehicles, and if the vehicle has the 3.6 L six-cylinder engine, the rear of the vehicle has a "3.6R" badge applied internationally. Black housing for headlights is not offered on the Outback worldwide. The Outback with 2.0 L diesel engine can be distinguished by its hood scoop and "Boxer Diesel" emblem on the rear. January 21, 2010, the Outback was introduced for sale in South Korea.
            
            Subaru introduced improvements to the chassis that they call Dynamic Chassis Control Concept, which uses high-tensile steel in critical areas to achieve high strength with lighter weight. The front-end structure introduces Cradle Mount that isolates the suspension and engine from the passenger compartment for a smoother and quieter ride using rubber mounts. New for this generation is a double wishbone rear suspension, with all suspension links and the rear differential isolated from the rear subframe with large rubber mounts to minimize noise and vibration intruding into the passenger compartment. Subaru has also added safety technologies such as Electronic Stability Control, Brake Assist, and Electronic Brakeforce Distribution to the list of standard features.
            
            In North America, the fourth generation Outback won Motor Trend's Sport/Utility of the Year Award for 2010, and Ward's Automotive Group's 2010 Interior of the Year awards in the popular-priced car category under $29,999.[20]
            
            North American models
            Trim level designations have been modified based on the engine installed; the Subaru EJ engine 2.5 L naturally aspirated engine are labeled 2.5i, 2.5i Premium, and 2.5i Limited, with the Subaru EZ 6-cylinder engine identified as 3.6R, 3.6R Premium and 3.6R Limited. As with previous generations, leather interior is only available in 2 colors (Warm Ivory or Off-Black) on Limited trim packages on specific exterior colors, and a glass moonroof is optional only on the Limited; cloth interiors are offered in the specified colors on lower trim level packages. A 440 W, 9-speaker Harman/Kardon audio system, using Dolby Pro Logic II technology and DTS Digital Sound, with Bluetooth and iPod capability is optional on the Limited trim packages. An 8 in (203 mm) voice activated GPS touch screen navigation system is optional only on the Limited. A separate Bluetooth wireless package with voice recognition, called Blueconnect, is available on lower trim levels and is not offered internationally. A Harman/Kardon-sourced stereo with a 6-disc in-dash CD changer and SRS Circle Surround sound is the standard sound system provided, with four speakers on all trim levels. A dual zone digital climate control system with 6-speed fan is standard and only available on the Limited; the base and Premium model have a 4-speed fan. Base and Premium trim levels have silver metallic trim on the interior door panels and dashboard; the Limited trim package has woodgrain accents.
            
            All trim levels are fitted with a retractable roof installed luggage rack, where the crossmembers are permanently attached but can be swung into the luggage carrier support structure when not in use, currently available only on North American models. Also, the North American Outback has lower side body claddings, which are not applied to international models (although the cladding may come on international models as a dealer-installed option). The interior retractable rear cargo cover has a separate storage compartment in the spare tire storage area so that the cargo cover can be removed for large items but stored inside the vehicle and out of the way. The rear seatbacks can be partially reclined for comfort.
            
            The 2010 model year had eight exterior colors: Azurite Blue Pearl, Crystal Black Silica, Cypress Green Pearl, Graphite Gray Metallic, Harvest Gold Metallic, Satin White Pearl, Sky Blue Metallic, Steel Silver Metallic.
            The 2011 model year had nine exterior colors: Azurite Blue Pearl, Caramel Bronze Pearl, Crystal Black Silica, Cypress Green Pearl, Graphite Gray Metallic, Ruby Red Pearl, Satin White Pearl, Sky Blue Metallic, Steel Silver Metallic. The exterior color Harvest Gold Metallic was removed for the 2011 model year. The exterior colors Caramel Bronze Pearl and Ruby Red Pearl were added for the 2011 model year.
            The 2012 model year had nine exterior colors: Caramel Bronze Pearl, Crystal Black Silica, Cypress Green Pearl, Deep Indigo Pearl, Graphite Gray Metallic, Ice Silver Metallic, Ruby Red Pearl, Satin White Pearl, Sky Blue Metallic. The exterior colors Azurite Blue Pearl and Steel Silver Metallic were removed for the 2012 model year. The exterior colors Deep Indigo Pearl and Ice Silver Metallic were added for the 2012 model year.
            The 2013 model year had ten exterior colors: Brilliant Brown Pearl (available for a limited time, in a Special Appearance Package only), Caramel Bronze Pearl, Crystal Black Silica, Cypress Green Pearl, Deep Indigo Pearl, Graphite Gray Metallic, Ice Silver Metallic, Satin White Pearl, Twilight Blue Metallic, and Venetian Red Pearl. The exterior colors Ruby Red Pearl and Sky Blue Metallic were removed for the 2013 model year. The exterior colors Twilight Blue Metallic and Venetian Red Pearl were added for the 2013 model year.
            All models are now available with painted exterior door handles, with black exterior side mirrors on the base level 2.5i, and painted mirrors on Premium and Limited. The Limited can be identified externally by simulated aluminium surround for the front foglights and matching trim piece on the bottom edges of the side door sill protector, front, and rear bumpers; the Premium and base model remain black. The grille appearance is unique on North American models so as to provide a visual similarity to the larger facelifted Tribeca and the third generation Forester. The 2.5i uses the flat-4 engine with 6-speed manual transmission or the optional Lineartronic Continuously variable transmission with steering column-mounted paddle shifters that allows the driver to select 6 "virtual gears" in manual mode. The 3.6R uses the flat-6 engine (from the Subaru Tribeca) exclusively with a 5-speed automatic transmission. The conventional automatic transmission is only available with the flat-6 engine, and the 6-speed manual transmission is not available on the 2.5i Limited. The PZEV Outback 2.5i, identified by a badge attached to the rear of the vehicle, continues to be sold in all 50 states, unlike other manufacturers who only sell PZEV certified vehicles in states that have adopted California emission standards. All other models have been certified LEV2 or ULEV.
            
            In the States, in 2010 and 2011 Erika Davies is the voice of the Subaru Outback commercial featuring the song "I Love You, I Do".[21]
            
            For the 2013 model year, Subaru refreshed the Outback, and it debuted at the 2012 New York Auto Show.
            
            Japanese models
            The Japanese-specification Outback is available with either the 2.5 L flat-4 or the 3.6 L flat-6 engine.[22] The EJ20 engine is no longer used in the Legacy or the Legacy Outback.[23] The trim levels are 2.5i, 2.5i L package and 3.6R and 3.6R SI-Cruise. SI-Cruise is an autonomous cruise control system that can reduce or resume a preset speed or bring the vehicle to a complete stop if the system detects a slower vehicle is being followed, without driver intervention. Air vents are installed for rear passengers at the back of the center front armrest compartment. The front hood (bonnet) and front bumper covers are not interchangeable with the North American version due to slight changes in the sheet metal. Turn signal repeaters are still integrated into the side exterior mirrors on all Japanese-spec models. Woodgrain accents are standard on the "L" package and the SI-Cruise vehicle, silver accents on lower trim levels.
            
            
            SI-Drive control knob (earlier version)
            SI-Drive, or Subaru Intelligent-Drive,[24] (Japanese: SI-Drive) is standard equipment on all trim versions. It is a feature that enables three distinctly different modes of vehicle performance characteristics (identified as "Sport", "Sport Sharp", and "Intelligent") by regulating the engine control unit (ECU), the automatic transmission control unit (TCU, if equipped), and by fine-tuning the electronically controlled throttle. The SI-Drive control knob is installed on the center console between the heated front seat control switches. The "Intelligent" mode makes throttle response more gradual, and decreases maximum engine power by 10 percent. The "Sport" mode allows the engine to run at higher speeds and increases fuel efficiency by 5 percent in comparison to Subaru engines without the feature. The "Sport # (Sharp)" mode makes throttle response more abrupt and enables the automatic transmission to maintain higher RPMs within a given gear's range, and minimizes the electric power steering wheel effort. When the engine is started, the default setting is the "Sport" selection.
            
            Japanese buyers can choose two different premium level entertainment systems; they can select the previously described Harman/Kardon GPS-stereo with six speakers, or a McIntosh sourced GPS/stereo with Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound, a separate powered amplifier and 10 speakers. Both units are Gracenote, G-BOOK and VICS enabled, with both systems available with an internal 600 MHz 40GB HDD coupled with a digital TV tuner that can be watched when the transmission is in park and the parking brake applied. Both stereos are compatible with CD, CD-R/RW, DVD and DVD R/RW as well as MP3 and WMA music formats. A Harman/Kardon sourced stereo with a 6-disc in-dash CD changer and SRS Circle Surround sound is the entry level sound system offered with six speakers and is standard equipment. The McIntosh stereo facia is offered in the trademark black with a clear plastic overlay and the center dashboard trim piece retains the brushed aluminum appearance but the color is black, with the climate controls offered in a matching black appearance, instead of the standard silver. Oddly, the Japanese version has a retractable cover for the console installed cupholders, whereas the North American version has exposed cupholders without a retractable cover. The dual-zone climate control system is standard on all trim levels.
            
            The GPS navigation system can be displayed in a split-screen format showing both two- and three dimensions with graphic landmarks instead of a flat screen without geographical images. HID headlights are standard on all models except the base 2.5i, as well as automatic rain sensing windshield wipers and headlight washers. A smart key is available as an option coupled with two position memory seat that memorizes driver's seat positions and adjustments, exterior mirror adjustment, and climate control settings. The settings can be customized based on the smart key module being used to unlock and start the car. The Outback can be fitted with twin white LED lights installed on the interior hatch vertically surrounding the rear window, with a separate light switch for additional illumination when the rear hatch is open.
            
            On the first anniversary of the introduction of the fourth generation, "EyeSight" was once again offered on the Japanese-spec Outback. EyeSight consists of 2 cameras with one on each side of the interior rear-view mirror, that use human-like stereoscopic vision to judge distances and generally keep tabs on the driver. The system can help maintain a safe distance on the highway, a lane departure warning system, a wake up call when traffic lights change, and even keeps an eye out for pedestrians. SI-Cruise has been integrated into the EyeSight feature as a driver safety aid.
            
            European models
            The European engine choices are the flat-4 EE20 2.0 L turbodiesel, the EJ25 2.5 L or the EZ36 3.6 L flat-6, with SI-Drive available only on the six-cylinder. Trim level packages are the 2.0D Comfort, Trend and Active, the 2.5i Comfort and Trend, or the 3.6R Exclusive. The interior colors of Warm Ivory or Off Black are offered, but the Warm Ivory interior is only available in leather. Wood accents are only available on the Exclusive trim package. The dual-zone climate control system is standard on all trim levels. The turbodiesel is available with the Warm Ivory interior with the Harman/Kardon sound system with six speakers and the satellite navigation, but the only transmission offered is the six-speed manual transmission. Cruise control, heated seats, automatic windshield wipers, HID headlights with headlight washers, heated exterior mirrors, glass moonroof and 17" wheels are standard equipment. The smart key is available only on the Exclusive or Comfort trim packages, coupled with the satellite navigation system and memory seats. The front hood (bonnet) and front bumper covers use the Japanese configuration, with turnsignal repeaters on the exterior mirrors, and standard equipment front and rear foglights. The turbodiesel and the 2.5i engines are Euro5 compliant.
            
            2013 brings a facelift of the model with minor updates on the exterior and interior. Steering and handling is improved, and CVT is offered with the diesel engine. A new multimedia navigation unit is offered.
            
            United Kingdom models
            The Outback is available to United Kingdom buyers with a choice of the flat-4 Subaru EE turbodiesel with a 6-speed manual transmission, the 2.5 L flat-4 with the CVT transmission, or the 3.6 L flat-6 engine with SI-Drive and a 5-speed automatic transmission. The trim level packages are the 2.0D SE and 2.0D SE NavPlus diesel, the 2.5i SE and the 2.5i SE NavPlus and the 3.6R. The interior is offered in black only, with leather on all trim levels. The interior trim strips on the doors and dashboard are silver on all models except the 3.6R, which has woodgrain trim. The front bumper and bonnet use the Japanese configuration, to include self-levelling HID headlights and headlight washers. The UK and Europe are offered an exterior paint selection, called Camellia Red Pearl that is not available in Japan or North America. For vehicle security, a Thatcham Category 1 perimeter alarm and immobiliser, along with a rolling code ECU engine immobiliser are standard equipment. The dual-zone climate control system is standard on all trim levels. The 2.5i and the turbodiesel engines are Euro5 compliant.
            
            The smart key is available on NavPlus and 3.6R models only. 17" alloy wheels are standard on all models, as well as rain sensing automatic wipers, two position memory seat, heated exterior mirrors, glass moonroof, heated front seats, fog lights, and tilt and telescoping steering wheel. The Harman/Kardon stereo with 6 speakers and the rear-view backup camera is installed only on vehicles with the voice recognition NavPlus system. The standard stereo system uses an in-dash 6-disc CD auto-changer and automatic speed-sensing volume adjustment that is MP3 player compatible.
            
            South African models
            The Outback is offered with black interior; specifications are similar to European "Comfort" trim package. Outback 2.5i Premium is available with the choice of Lineartronic CVT or six-speed manual transmission, including leather trim, memory function for the driver's seat, electric sunroof, dual zone climate control and rear air vents. Satellite navigation is not offered along with the premium Harman/Kardon sound system.
            
            Recently, the 2.0 diesel (6-speed manual only) and 3.6R models have been introduced.

            Subaru Outback 2.0D (Facelift)
            
            Subaru Outback 2.0D (Facelift)
            The Outback sold in Australia resembles the vehicle sold in Europe, with some features only available in Japan. The trim level packages are the 2.5i, 2.5i Premium, 2.5i Premium SatNav, the 3.6R, 3.6R Premium SatNav and the diesel 2.0D, 2.0D Premium, 2.0D Premium SatNav. The engines offered are the EJ25, EZ36 and the EE20 turbodiesel. Australians can choose either the Lineartronic CVT or a 6-speed manual transmission on the EJ25, but transmission choices on the EZ36 are limited to the 5-speed automatic, and the EE20 turbodiesel is available with the 6-speed manual transmission exclusively. The Off Black interior color is standard across the range, however the Warm Ivory is available on the 3.6R, with leather interior offered on vehicles identified as "Premium". Cloth is offered on the 2.5i, 3.6R and the 2.0D. SI-Drive is only available on the 3.6R, following the international trend. The front bumper and hood (bonnet) use the Japanese configuration. The Australian EJ25 and EE20 engines are Euro4 compliant.
            
            The dual-zone climate control system is standard on all trim levels. Sound systems offered include the McIntosh stereo with 10 speakers, a separate powered amplifier and satellite navigation provided by "WhereIs", a service provided by Telstra Corporation Ltd, or the Harman/Kardon stereo with the satellite navigation and 6 speakers, or the unit offered in North America and Europe with a 6-disc in-dash CD changer and 6 speakers. The McIntosh unit sold in Australia has function buttons written in English and is different from the Japanese unit, due to Japanese characters being used on some of the functions. The Australian McIntosh or Harman/Kardon GPS-stereo packages are not Gracenote, G-BOOK and VICS enabled, and do not have the internal 600 MHz 40GB HDD coupled with a digital TV tuner. The center dashboard trim is color matched based on the stereo installed; if it has either one of the Harman/Kardon units, the trim color is silver brushed aluminum, and if the McIntosh is installed the trim color is black brushed aluminum. The climate controls are also colored either silver or black as well. Silver trim is installed on the doors and dashboard, with woodgrain available only on the 3.6R. Cruise control, heated seats, automatic windshield wipers, HID headlights with headlight washers, heated exterior mirrors, and 17" wheels are standard equipment. The smart key is available only on the 3.6R, and the glass moonroof is only offered on Premium trim packages.

            The fifth-generation Outback appeared in 2014 for the 2015 year model with the sixth generation Legacy, still badged the Legacy Outback for Japan. The sixth-generation Legacy was previewed as a concept at the Los Angeles Auto Show in November 2013;[25] the Legacy sedan was premiered at Chicago in February 2014,[26] with the Outback following at New York in April.[27] An unrelated Legacy-based "sports tourer" wagon, the Subaru Levorg, was shown in 2013 and first sold in 2014.[28] Elsewhere, the Outback became a free-standing model line of its own, independent of the Legacy, thus bringing greater product differentiation between the two.[27]
            
            Subaru billed the exterior styling evolution as being shaped by the concept of 'more Outback', claiming to combine the strengths of passenger cars and sport-utility vehicles and capitalizing on the brand recognition gained from selling the Outback since 1995.[27] EyeSight was offered for the first time in the European market on the new Outback.[29] Chassis stiffness was improved for the fifth-generation Outback.[27] To reduce aerodynamic drag, the side view mirrors were mounted on the sheet metal of the front doors rather than the base of the A-pillar, as was the case with previous models.[30]
            
            From 2018, some world markets also offered Subaru Adaptive Driving Beam (ADB) that allow a driver to leave their high beam switched on at all times, and in combination with EyeSight, adjust a series of shutters that cover portions of the high beam light projection to prevent dazzling oncoming drivers whilst maintaining visibility of the rest of the road, or to "draw a box" of low beam around a lead vehicle that adjusts left and right working with SRH in line with that vehicle's movement. Other additions include front and side cameras along with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and the ability to change the color of the combination meter illuminated rings to one of eleven different colors.[31]
            
            The fifth-generation Subaru Outback is now classified as a 'crossover', with the body and wheelbase set larger than previous models. Other technical changes such as the larger 256 hp (191 kW) 3.6L EZ36 engine have pushed it into this classification. The Outback received a Top Safety Pick award from the IIHS,[32] an ASV+ rating from JNCAP,[33] and five stars from NHTSA.[34]
            
            The fifth-generation Outback retained the same 2.5-litre FB25 and 3.6-litre EZ36 engines from the 2013 refresh; the FB25 was slightly revised to improve mid-range torque.[27] In China, the uplevel engine was a turbocharged 2.0-litre FA20F instead of the EZ36.[35] In the United States, the Outback was only offered with a single transmission choice, Subaru's continuously variable transmission branded Lineartronic.[27] In Canada, a manual transmission was available with the 2.5-litre Base and Touring models until 2017.[36]

            Outback Sport
            Main article: Subaru Impreza
            Subaru also released the first generation Impreza-based Outback Sport in 1994 to North America only for the 1995 model year. Derived from the Impreza hatchback, the Outback Sport initially featured an off-road appearance package with two-tone paint; otherwise, the mechanics of the platform were unchanged.

            Main article: Impreza (first generation)
            The first Impreza Outback Sport was introduced for the 1995 model year as a trim line based on the "L Active Safety Group", which included all-wheel-drive and front and rear disc anti-lock brakes. The standard engine was a 1.8-litre EJ18 with a manual transmission, but an automatic transmission was available exclusively with the larger 2.2-litre EJ22 from the Legacy. In addition, the Outback Sport received a roof rack and mud flaps, but ground clearance was unchanged from the Impreza wagon on which it was based at 6.3 in (160 mm).[71] The 1997 model year Outback Sport had larger tires than the Impreza and an increased ground clearance of 6.4 to 6.5 in (160 to 170 mm).[72]
            
            The Outback Sport was priced lower and aimed at a younger buyer than the Legacy-based Outback. Advertisements for the Outback Sport featured an actor who referred to Paul Hogan as his "uncle".[73]

            Subaru introduced the Impreza XV for the European and Australian markets at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show. The XV adopted the same changes that were made for the USDM Outback Sport, but the concept XV used the 2.0-litre turbodiesel EE20 or 2.0-litre turbo EJ20 engines available in other European Impreza variants.[75] In Australia, the XV replaced the RV line, equipped with the naturally aspirated EJ20.[76] It is succeeded by the Subaru XV/Crosstrek</p>
