Computer programming or coding is the composition of sequences of instructions called programs that computers can follow to perform tasks  it involves designing and implementing algorithms step by  step specifications of procedures by writing  code in one or more  programming languages  programmers typically  use high level programming languages that are more easily intelligible to humans than machine code which which is directly executed by the central processing unit proficient
Programming usually requires expertise in several different subjects including knowledge of the application domain details of programming languages and generic code libraries specialized algorithms and formal logic.

Auxiliary tasks accompanying and related to programming include analyzing requirement testing debugging (investigating and fixing problems) implementation of build systems and management of artifacts such as programs machine code while theses  are sometimes considered programming often terms programming  implementing and coding reserved for the writing and editing of code per second
